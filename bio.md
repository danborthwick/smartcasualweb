Using technology in novel ways to improve people's lives has always been what gets me out of bed in the morning. Over fourteen years in the games industry has confirmed the thrill of seeing my work in the hands of real users. Nowadays that same philosophy applies across a broad range of interests including machine learning, behaviour change, VR and voice interfaces.  
 
### Design & Consultancy
Using game design as a tool to inspire positive behaviour change is a particular interest. Past consultancy projects have included:
- Co-designing services and digital tools with the UK Goverment's [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk) to help people manage their finances through the transition to the forthcoming [Universal Credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Credit) welfare reforms. A challenging project to use gamified incentives in a sensitive way for a broad demographic.<br>&nbsp;
- User focussed design and development of tools and services for the Victorian Department of Justice's [Work Development Permit scheme](https://www.justice.vic.gov.au/wdp).<br>&nbsp;
- Other previous clients include [Samsung Health](https://health.apps.samsung.com) and the [BBC World Service Trust (now BBC Media Action)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction).
 
### Voice and AI
Recent work has included [Word Mine](https://www.amazon.com/Sensible-Object-Ltd-Word-Mine/dp/B07JJFZXW9), an anagram game played entirely through a voice interface on Amazon Alexa (with [Sensible Object](http://sensibleobject.com)), development of an AI driven app for home detection of oral health issues, and a chatbot allowing users to plan journeys on Public Transport Victoria's travel network.
